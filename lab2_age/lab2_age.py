# Write a program that asks the user to enter a personâ€™s age.
# The program should display a message indicating whether the person
# is an infant, a child, a teenager, or an adult. Following are the guidelines:
# If the person is 1 year old or less, he or she is an infant.
# If the person is older than 1 year, but younger than 13 years, he or she is a child.
# If the person is at least 13 years old, but less than 20 years old, he or she is a teenager.
# If the person is at least 20 years old, he or she is an adult.

# Prompt user for age
userAge = int(input('Please enter your AGE: '))

# Determine age calculation.
if userAge <= 1:
    print('You are a Infant')
elif userAge < 13:
    print('You are a Child')
elif userAge < 20:
    print('You are a Teenager')
elif userAge >= 20:
    print('You are an Adult')
