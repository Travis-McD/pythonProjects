# This is a program that creates a menu and gives user choices for name and email --used class video for birthdays

# Using the Dictionaries concepts and methods discussed in class,
#
# Write a program that keeps names and email addresses in a dictionary as key-value pairs.
#
# The program should display a menu that lets the user look up a personâ€™s email address,
# add a new name and email address, change an existing email address, and delete an existing name and email address.

# global constants for menu
