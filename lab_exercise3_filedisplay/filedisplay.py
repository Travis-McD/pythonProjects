# This program (see below)
# Creates a text file named display.txt containing at least ten (10) U.S States (as strings).
# The text file must be saved in this assignment's Python folder and submitted with the python program (.py) file.
# Write a program that asks the user for the name of a file.
# The program should display only the first five lines of the fileâ€™s contents (States).
